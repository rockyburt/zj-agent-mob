![Zellij 0.44+](https://img.shields.io/badge/zellij-0.44%2B-green.svg)

**Keep track of every coding agent you have running, from one floating panel.**

Run enough Claude Code and Codex agents and they scatter across panes, tabs, and whole Zellij sessions. This panel shows all of them at once: who is working, who is blocked waiting on you, and who finished while you were elsewhere. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to jump straight to any of them, even in another session.

![Seven agents across three Zellij sessions in one list; a permission prompt is approved from the panel and another is always-allowed, the list is narrowed by typing, a question is answered and a follow-up queued, statuses move through compact, done and failed, then the kill confirm and the install screen; an agent two sessions away blocks and sorts to the top, and Enter jumps straight into its pane](demo/tour.gif)

A blocked agent is invisible until you happen to cycle past its pane. Rows sort
by urgency, so whatever needs you most sits at the top.

- **Every agent at once**, across sessions, with live status and the task each is on.
- **Background agents too**, from Claude Code's own agent view (`claude agents`) —
  the ones running under the daemon with no pane at all, across every account.
- **Jump to any pane** with <kbd>Enter</kbd>, across tabs *and* sessions.
- **Fuzzy find** with <kbd>/</kbd>: a few characters of a task, worktree, or
  session narrows the list to it.
- **Told when you are away**: a desktop notification the moment an agent blocks or fails.
- **Answer in place**: <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>r</kbd> for permission prompts, <kbd>A</kbd> to always allow a tool,
  <kbd>y</kbd> / <kbd>m</kbd> to reply.
- **Kill a runaway** with <kbd>x</kbd>, two-step so you never do it by accident.
- **No daemon and no socket.** Hooks pipe straight to the plugin and drop a
  disposable status file for other sessions to read.

> Inspired by [herdr](https://herdr.dev), without adopting an entire new multiplexer.

> `ZELLIJ_PANE_ID`, so it sees only agents running in a pane; a `claude --bg`
> session has a pid but no pane, no `ZELLIJ_*` environment and no hook piping
> into any session, which made exactly the unattended agents invisible. See

## Requirements

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| Zellij 0.44+ | Plugin API (`LaunchOrFocusPlugin`, pipes, `RunCommandResult`) |
| Rust + `wasm32-wasip1` target | Only to build from source; not needed if you download a release |

## Quick start

Three steps: install, bind a key, restart your agents.

### 1. Install

No clone and no Rust toolchain required:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mohseenrm/zj-agent-mob/releases/download/v0.12.0/init.sh | sh
```

This downloads the plugin and hook script for that release, wires up whichever of Claude Code and Codex you have, and leaves an installer at `~/.config/zj-agent-mob/install.sh` so the in-panel install screen works from then on.

Prefer to read before running? Same thing in two steps:

```sh
curl -fsSL -O https://github.com/mohseenrm/zj-agent-mob/releases/download/v0.12.0/init.sh
less init.sh && sh init.sh
```

<details>
<summary>Or build it from source</summary>

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
./init.sh
```

From a clone, `./init.sh` uses your local build and downloads nothing.

Reinstalling over an existing install, or syncing a checkout across machines? Use
`./scripts/reinstall-local.sh`, which also clears Zellij's plugin cache and any stale
status records - both of which survive a plain `init.sh` and keep old behaviour live.
`--check` reports whether what is installed matches your checkout.

</details>

### 2. Bind a key

Add to `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`:

```kdl
keybinds {
    session {
        bind "c" {
            LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
                floating true
                move_to_focused_tab true
            }
            SwitchToMode "Normal"
        }
    }
}
```

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> then <kbd>c</kbd> to open the panel.

### 3. Restart your agents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restart any running `claude` / `codex` sessions after installing. Hooks are read at session start, so existing sessions won't report status.

Then start an agent in any pane and open the panel: it shows up within a turn. If the panel stays empty, [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#the-panel-says-no-agents-in-this-session) walks through it in order.

See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for per-target install, the in-panel install screen, layout registration, and every config knob.

## Screens

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**The agent list.** One row per agent: status, elapsed time, where it runs
(`repo/worktree` once the hooks report git identity), task, and an indented
detail line. A renamed pane wins as the task label, and a `⑂N` badge counts
running subagents.

![The agent list: one row per agent with status, elapsed time, project, and task](docs/img/02-agent-list.png)

</td>
<td width="50%">

**First run.** With no hooks installed nothing can report, so the panel offers
to install rather than sitting empty.

![The setup screen listing four quick actions: install for Claude Code, for Codex, for both, or quit](docs/img/01-setup.png)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Killing an agent.** <kbd>x</kbd> interrupts and arms the row; again closes the
pane.

![The agent list with the selected row showing "press x again to close pane" in red](docs/img/03-kill-armed.png)

</td>
<td width="50%">

**The install screen** (<kbd>i</kbd>). Each target toggles independently, so
running only one agent's hooks is supported.

## Keys

### Agent list

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| <kbd>j</kbd> / <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd> / <kbd>↑</kbd> | Move selection |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Jump to that agent's pane (across tabs *and* sessions) and hide the panel |
| <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd> | Jump straight to agent N |
| <kbd>g</kbd> <var>N</var> <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Jump to any row by number, including past 9. <kbd>g</kbd> opens a count, <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>G</kbd> closes it: `g25`<kbd>Enter</kbd>, or `g25G` for the vim spelling |
| <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>g</kbd> / <kbd>G</kbd> | First row / last row |
| <kbd>/</kbd> | Fuzzy find: type to narrow the list (task, worktree, path, session, tool, status), <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd>/<kbd>↑</kbd> to pick a match, <kbd>Enter</kbd> jumps to it, <kbd>Esc</kbd> cancels. Smartcase, like vim |
| <kbd>s</kbd> | Cycle the ordering: urgency (default) -> grouped by project (the git repo, so worktrees group together) -> grouped by session |
| <kbd>x</kbd> | Send SIGINT to the agent; press again to close the pane (any session) |
| <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>r</kbd> | Approve / reject a parked permission prompt |
| <kbd>A</kbd> | Approve, and stop that tool asking again |
| <kbd>f</kbd> | Queue a follow-up, delivered when the turn ends |
| <kbd>y</kbd> | Answer a blocked agent with `y` (only shown while it is waiting) |
| <kbd>m</kbd> | Type a one-line reply to a blocked agent; <kbd>Enter</kbd> sends, <kbd>Esc</kbd> cancels |
| <kbd>o</kbd> | Expand the selected row's subagents into one line each; press again to collapse |
| <kbd>d</kbd> | Dismiss a `done` badge |
| <kbd>D</kbd> | Dismiss every `done` badge at once |
| <kbd>n</kbd> | Open a new agent in a floating pane, in the selected row's directory (advertised in the empty state rather than the footer) |
| <kbd>i</kbd> | Open the install screen |
| <kbd>q</kbd> / <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Hide the panel |

### Install screen

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| <kbd>c</kbd> / <kbd>x</kbd> / <kbd>p</kbd> | Toggle Claude hooks / Codex hooks / the plugin wasm |
| <kbd>j</kbd> / <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd> / <kbd>↑</kbd> | Move selection |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Toggle the selected row |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Re-read install state |
| <kbd>i</kbd> / <kbd>q</kbd> / <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Back to the agent list |

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Hook event |
|---|---|---|
| `failed` | Stopped by an error (rate limit, billing, auth) | `StopFailure` (Claude only) |
| `waiting` | Needs you now (permission prompt / question) | `Notification` (Claude), `PermissionRequest` (both) |
| `idle-wait` | Has been waiting on you for a while | `Notification` / `idle_prompt` (Claude only) |
| `done` | Finished while you were elsewhere | `Stop` |
| `compact` | Compacting context (looks like a hang otherwise) | `PreCompact`, cleared by `PostCompact` |
| `working` | Processing a turn | `UserPromptSubmit`, refreshed by `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` |
| `idle` | Session open, nothing new | `SessionStart`, or `done` after you visit the pane |
| `found` | Spotted by the process scan, but it has never fired a hook | - |
| `unknown` | Running, but nothing has reported on it in a while ([stuck there?](docs/troubleshooting.md#a-row-in-another-session-says-unknown)) | - |
| `gone` | Its Zellij session is gone, so its state is unknowable | - |

Rows sort in that order, so whatever needs you most is at the top. A `found` row is normal rather than broken: the agent was already running when hooks were installed, and it fills in the moment it next does anything.

### Ordering and grouping

<kbd>s</kbd> cycles the ordering: urgency (default), grouped by project, then
grouped by session. Each group is ranked by its **most urgent member**, so
grouping never buries a blocked agent under a quiet project. The active mode
shows in the header; the default needs no announcing.

```
zj-agent-mob   1 waiting · 2 working   [project groups · s]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  api (2)
▶ 1 ● claude  waiting    12s  api        Fix the failing auth test
      └ wants: permission · needs approval: git push --force · pane:6
  2 ⠙ claude  working     41s  api        Port the hook suite to Rust
  web (1)
  3 ⠙ codex   working   2m10s  web        Update the checkout flow
```

### Why an agent is blocked

A `waiting` row says what kind of answer it wants, so you can triage without
visiting a pane. Only a `permission` is a yes/no the panel can answer:

| `wants:` | You can |
|---|---|
| `permission` | Answer with <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>r</kbd>, or <kbd>A</kbd> to always allow that tool |
| `plan` | Read it - <kbd>Enter</kbd> to the pane |
| `question` | Reply with <kbd>m</kbd>, or jump to the pane |
| `idle` | Nothing is blocked on a decision |

### Answering permission prompts from the panel

On by default; `ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE=0` in the agent's environment opts out. A permission prompt
parks in the panel and <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>r</kbd> approve or reject it without leaving the panel:

```
▶ 1 ● codex   waiting    2s  web        Fix flaky checkout test
      └ needs approval: rm -rf node_modules · pane:5
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Bash                                     │
        │ rm -rf node_modules                      │
        │ a approve  r reject  A always  ↵ pane   │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

It waits `ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 30) and then falls through to the agent's own
prompt, so the worst case is the normal interactive experience. Reject is <kbd>r</kbd>, not
<kbd>d</kbd>, so a mis-keyed dismiss can never answer a prompt.

<kbd>A</kbd> approves *and* stops that tool asking again, by appending a line to
`~/.config/zj-agent-mob/approve.rules`:

```
allow Read
allow Bash git
```

A matching rule is answered immediately, with no prompt and no wait, so a fleet only interrupts
you for something new. Allow-only: a wrong auto-deny wedges a turn, where a wrong auto-allow is
still bounded by whatever the agent's own sandbox permits.

### Queueing the next instruction

<kbd>f</kbd> composes a follow-up for the selected agent. It is delivered when the current turn
ends, so the agent picks it up and keeps going instead of stopping:

```
▶ 1 ⠙ claude  working   1m4s  api        Add retry to webhook client
      └ follow-up: now run the tests · 3 turns · pane:5
```

Unlike a reply this needs no prompt to be open - a working agent is exactly what it is for - and
it reaches agents in other sessions. `ZJ_AGENT_FOLLOWUP=0` opts out.

### Desktop notifications

On by default. When an agent starts `waiting` or `failed`, you get a system notification even
when Zellij is not the focused window - which is exactly when a blocked agent is invisible.

A burst becomes one banner rather than five, each agent is rate-limited to one notification a
minute, and nothing fires while the panel is already on screen. To change what it notifies about:

```kdl
LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
    floating true
    notify "waiting,failed,done"   // add done; "" turns notifications off
    notify_sound "true"
}
```

### Fleet status in your status bar

Set `summary_file` and the panel publishes the fleet's state on every change, so
you know whether anyone needs you without opening anything:

```kdl
    summary_file "/tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary"
```

Two files, both written atomically: the prose line (`2 waiting · 3 working`,
empty when nothing needs you) and `<path>.kv` for consumers that would rather
not parse prose:

```
failed=0 waiting=2 working=1 done=0 found=0 total=3
```

The prose line is also piped as `zj-agent-mob-summary`, so
[zjstatus](https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus) can pick it up with its `pipe`
widget. Both formats are a stated contract - see
[the fleet summary](docs/setup.md#the-fleet-summary-in-your-status-bar) for
worked starship, tmux and shell examples.

## Known limitations

- Agents started before `init.sh` ran aren't tracked (no hooks installed yet). Restart them.
- Agents in other sessions report through a status file in `$TMPDIR`. The states that need you (`waiting`, `failed`, `done`) pipe across immediately; quieter ones wait for the next scan (5s).
- Claude has no "permission granted" event, so `waiting` to `working` relies on the next tool-event heartbeat. With `ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT=0`, `waiting` persists until the turn ends.
- Notifications need a notifier on `PATH` (`terminal-notifier` / `osascript` on macOS, `notify-send` on Linux). Without one, everything else still works.

## Releases

Prebuilt `zj-agent-mob.wasm` binaries and changelogs are on the [releases page](https://github.com/mohseenrm/zj-agent-mob/releases). Pushing a `v*` tag builds the wasm, verifies it exports what Zellij needs, and publishes it automatically.
