## Install

Two options: let `init.sh` download a release for you, or build the wasm yourself. `jq` is required either way.

### From a release

Each release ships three assets: `init.sh`, `zj-agent-mob-hook.sh`, and `zj-agent-mob.wasm`. The installer fetches the two it needs from the same tag it was downloaded from, so one command is the whole install:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mohseenrm/zj-agent-mob/releases/download/v0.12.0/init.sh | sh
```

No clone, no Rust toolchain, no manual `target/` directory. To inspect the script first:

```sh
curl -fsSL -O https://github.com/mohseenrm/zj-agent-mob/releases/download/v0.12.0/init.sh
less init.sh && sh init.sh
```

The URL names an explicit tag rather than `latest` on purpose. The installer, hook script, and wasm are versioned together, so a moving `latest` could pair a new plugin with an older hook on disk, and Zellij caches remote plugins by URL, which would keep serving a stale binary. Grab the newest tag from the [releases page](https://github.com/mohseenrm/zj-agent-mob/releases) and substitute it.

Pin a different release with `--version`:

```sh
sh init.sh --version v0.2.0
```

Naming a version always downloads that release, even if a local build is present, so you get what you asked for.

### From source

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
./init.sh
```

From a clone with a local build, `init.sh` downloads nothing.

`init.sh` installs the hook script, copies the plugin, and merges hook entries into `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json` without disturbing hooks you already have. It is idempotent, so re-running it is safe.

```sh
./init.sh                  # install everything
./init.sh install claude   # just Claude Code's hooks
./init.sh install codex    # just Codex's hooks
./init.sh install plugin   # just copy the built wasm
./init.sh status           # what is installed right now
./init.sh --dry-run        # preview, write nothing (never downloads)
./init.sh uninstall        # remove exactly what was installed
./init.sh uninstall codex  # remove one target only
./init.sh --from-release   # prefer the released wasm over a local build
./init.sh --version v0.2.0 # pin a release; implies --from-release
./init.sh --no-download    # fail rather than fetch anything (offline)
```

By default the installer downloads only what the source tree does not already provide: from a clone with a built wasm it stays entirely local, and from a bare `init.sh` it fetches the hook and plugin. `--from-release` and `--no-download` force each end of that.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restart any running `claude` / `codex` sessions after installing. Hooks are read at session start, so existing sessions won't report status.

### Reinstalling from a checkout

`init.sh` always overwrites the hook and the wasm, but two things survive it and
will keep you on old behaviour:

- **Zellij caches compiled plugins.** A new wasm on disk is not the wasm a
  running session has loaded.
- **Spool records outlive a hook change.** A record written by an older hook
  stays in `$TMPDIR` until it is swept.

`scripts/reinstall-local.sh` does the whole cycle, which is what you want when
you are moving the same checkout across machines:

```sh
./scripts/reinstall-local.sh          # build, install, clear both caches
./scripts/reinstall-local.sh --check  # is the install current? exits 1 if not
```

`--check` compares the installed wasm and hook against the checkout and prints
`ok` or `STALE` for each, so you can tell at a glance whether a machine is
actually running what you think it is.

Afterwards, restart your agents *and* start a new Zellij session - a new session
is the reliable way to make Zellij load the new plugin.

## The install screen

After the first run you can do all of this from inside the panel instead: press <kbd>i</kbd> for the install screen.

![The install screen with Claude Code hooks and the plugin installed, Codex hooks absent](img/05-install-partial.png)

With hooks installed but no agent running yet, the panel says so rather than
looking broken - start `claude` or `codex` in any pane and it fills in:

![The empty state telling you to start claude or codex in a pane](img/00-empty.png)

Each row toggles: pressing its key installs when absent and uninstalls when present.

If neither agent is hooked, the panel skips the empty state and offers the same install directly:

![The setup screen listing four quick actions: install for Claude Code, for Codex, for both, or quit](img/01-setup.png)

The screen shells out to the copy of the installer that `init.sh` leaves at `~/.config/zj-agent-mob/install.sh`, so it works regardless of where you cloned the repo. This needs Zellij's "Run commands" permission, which the plugin requests on first load.

## Register the plugin with Zellij

`init.sh` copies the plugin to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm`, but Zellij still needs to know how to open it.

### As a keybinding

Add to `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`:

```kdl
keybinds {
    // Ctrl s already enters Session mode; c opens the panel from there.
    session {
        bind "c" {
            LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
                floating true
                move_to_focused_tab true
            }
            SwitchToMode "Normal"
        }
    }
}
```

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> then <kbd>c</kbd> to open the panel.

To bind a single chord instead, put it in `shared_except` so it works from any mode:

```kdl
keybinds {
    shared_except "locked" {
        bind "Ctrl a" {
            LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
                floating true
                move_to_focused_tab true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### In a layout

To have the panel present from the start, add it to `~/.config/zellij/layouts/default.kdl`:

```kdl
layout {
    pane size=1 borderless=true { plugin location="zellij:tab-bar"; }
    pane
    floating_panes {
        pane {
            plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm"
            width "80%"
            height "50%"
        }
    }
}
```

Validate whatever you write with:

```sh
zellij setup --check
```

## Configuration

Plugin config goes in the same block as the launch action:

```kdl
LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
    floating true
    move_to_focused_tab true
    popup_on_waiting true
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `popup_on_waiting` | `true` | Auto-show the panel when an agent needs input. Set `false` to only ever open it yourself |
| `discover` | `true` | Scan process environments for agents that have not fired a hook yet, including ones in other sessions. Set `false` to show only agents that have reported |
| `notify` | `waiting,failed` | Which transitions raise a desktop notification. Any of `waiting`, `idlewait`, `failed`, `done`, comma-separated. `""` disables them |
| `notify_cooldown` | `60` | Seconds before the same agent may notify again, so a flapping row cannot spam you |
| `notify_sound` | `false` | Play a sound with the notification |
| `summary_file` | unset | Write the fleet summary here on every change, for a status bar to render. Also writes `<path>.kv` for parsing. Unset means nothing is published. See [the fleet summary](#the-fleet-summary-in-your-status-bar) |
| `check_updates` | `true` | Check GitHub for a newer release on load, via the installed `install.sh`. Set `false` to never touch the network. See [updating](#updating) |

## Updating

On load the panel asks the installed `~/.config/zj-agent-mob/install.sh` for the
latest release tag (cached for six hours, so many sessions loading at once make
one request). When a newer release exists a dim footer line appears:

```
update available: v0.12.0 (press U)
```

Press <kbd>U</kbd> (from the list or the install screen) and the panel drives
`install.sh --version <tag> plugin`, which downloads the new wasm, hook script
and installer, swaps them into place, and reloads the plugin in this session.
Agent hooks in your settings files are never touched by an update.

Other Zellij sessions keep running the old code until their own reload; their
next <kbd>U</kbd> finds the files already current and just reloads. Running
agents pick up the new hook script on their next hook fire, and the current
version is always shown in the install screen header (<kbd>i</kbd>).

Set `check_updates false` to disable the check entirely; `install.sh --version
vX.Y.Z` from a shell still updates (or downgrades) manually.

## The fleet summary in your status bar

The panel publishes the fleet's state on every change, for anything outside
Zellij to render. This is the difference between a panel you open and a number
that is always in front of you.

**In this fork it is on by default**, written to
`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/zj-agent-mob-$(id -u)/summary` (and `summary.kv`) with no
configuration at all. That is deliberate: Zellij treats the same plugin with a
different configuration as a *different plugin* when routing a pipe, so a
keybinding that sets `summary_file` opens an instance the hooks'
`zellij pipe --plugin` never reaches, and the panel you open stops hearing from
its own session's agents. Leave the plugin unconfigured and read the default
path. `summary_file "off"` disables it, and a path overrides it, both at that
same cost.

Configuration otherwise goes wherever you already declare the plugin - in a keybinding:

```kdl
keybinds {
    shared_except "locked" {
        bind "Ctrl a" {
            LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
                floating true
                summary_file "/tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

or in a layout:

```kdl
floating_panes {
    pane {
        plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm" {
            summary_file "/tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary"
        }
    }
}
```

Two files are written, both replaced atomically via `mv`, so a consumer polling
them never reads a half-written count:

| File | Contents | For |
|---|---|---|
| `$summary_file` | `2 waiting · 1 working` | Rendering directly |
| `$summary_file.kv` | `failed=0 waiting=2 working=1 done=0 found=0 total=3` | Parsing |

A `zellij pipe --name zj-agent-mob-summary` also carries the prose line, for
consumers that are themselves Zellij plugins.

### The format contract

Both lines are stable, and worth relying on:

- **Prose** (`$summary_file`) lists only non-zero counts, in urgency order
  (`failed`, `waiting`, `working`, `done`), joined by ` · `. It is **empty when
  nothing needs you**, which is what keeps a status bar quiet at rest.
- **Machine-readable** (`$summary_file.kv`) always carries **every** key, zeros
  included, so `waiting=0` is never ambiguous with a key that was left out.
  `waiting` folds in `idle-wait`; `working` folds in `compact`; `found` is
  agents seen by the scan that have never reported; `total` is every row.

Neither file exists until the first publish, so read defensively.

### Worked examples

**Starship** - a module that stays invisible when nothing needs you:

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml
[custom.agents]
command = "cat /tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary 2>/dev/null"
when = "test -s /tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary"
format = "[$output]($style) "
style = "bold yellow"
shell = ["sh", "-c"]
```

**tmux** - the prose line, refreshed on tmux's own interval:

```sh
set -g status-right '#(cat /tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary 2>/dev/null) | %H:%M'
```

**Anything that needs a decision**, reading the `k=v` line rather than parsing
prose. One field, no sourcing:

```sh
waiting=$(awk -v RS=' ' -F= '$1=="waiting"{print $2}' \
  /tmp/zj-agent-mob.summary.kv 2>/dev/null)

[ "${waiting:-0}" -gt 0 ] && printf 'agents blocked: %s\n' "$waiting"
```

**Zellij's own status bar** cannot shell out, so it reads the pipe rather than
the file - see [how it works](how-it-works.md) for the pipe's shape.

### Hook script environment

Set these in the environment the *agent* runs in, not the panel's.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ZJ_AGENT_TOOL` | `claude` | Which transcript reader to use (`claude` / `codex`) |
| `ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT` | `1` | Set `0` to skip `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` (halves hook volume) |
| `ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE` | `1` | Set `0` to stop parking permission prompts in the panel for <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>r</kbd> |
| `ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Seconds a parked prompt waits before falling through to the agent's own prompt |
| `ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE_RULES` | `~/.config/zj-agent-mob/approve.rules` | Rules that answer a prompt without asking. One `allow <tool> [arg-prefix]` per line; <kbd>A</kbd> appends one |
| `ZJ_AGENT_FOLLOWUP` | `1` | Set `0` to stop delivering a follow-up queued with <kbd>f</kbd> when the turn ends |
| `ZJ_AGENT_CONTEXT` | `1` | Set `0` to stop telling an agent about other agents working in the same directory |
| `ZJ_AGENT_SLOW_TOOL` | `10` | Seconds a tool call must take before its duration is shown on the detail line |
| `ZJ_AGENT_SPOOL` | `1` | Set `0` to stop writing the cross-session status file. Agents in other sessions then show `found` instead of live status |
| `ZJ_AGENT_SPOOL_DIR` | `$TMPDIR/zj-agent-mob-<uid>/status` | Where status files are written. Created `0700`, since records contain task summaries |
| `ZJ_AGENT_FANOUT` | `1` | Set `0` to stop piping `waiting` / `failed` / `done` straight to panels in other sessions. They then wait for the next poll instead |
| `ZJ_AGENT_PLUGIN` | `file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zj-agent-mob.wasm` | Plugin path |
| `ZJ_AGENT_DEBUG` | `0` | Set `1` to log events to `~/.cache/zj-agent-mob/hook.log` |

### Installer environment

Mostly useful for testing against throwaway directories:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `ZJ_AGENT_HOOK_DIR` | `~/.config/zj-agent-mob` |
| `ZJ_AGENT_PLUGIN_DIR` | `~/.config/zellij/plugins` |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.claude` |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex` |
