## Status transport

Each hook event runs `scripts/zj-agent-mob-hook.sh`, which forwards status to the plugin:

```sh
zellij pipe --name agent-status --plugin file:...wasm \
  --args "pane_id=$ZELLIJ_PANE_ID,tool=claude,status=waiting,..."
```

An interrupted turn (Esc) reports `idle-wait` with `interrupted`, so a row that
the user just stopped stops claiming to be working.

`$ZELLIJ_PANE_ID` is set by Zellij in every terminal pane and is inherited by processes started there, so it identifies the exact pane. If it isn't set, the hook exits immediately, which is what scopes monitoring to the current session: agents outside Zellij are ignored, and each session's plugin instance only sees its own panes.

`zellij pipe --plugin` auto-launches the plugin if it isn't running, so there's no daemon and no socket.

### Why a blocked agent is blocked

`detail=` says what a prompt is *about*; a separate `block=` says what kind of
answer it wants, which is what decides whether the panel can settle it:

| `block=` | Comes from | Rendered as |
|---|---|---|
| `tool` | `PermissionRequest`, or `Notification` / `permission_prompt` | `wants: permission` |
| `plan` | `PermissionRequest` with `tool_name=ExitPlanMode` | `wants: plan` |
| `question` | `Notification` with no recognized type | `wants: question` |
| `idle` | `Notification` / `idle_prompt`, `agent_needs_input`, or `Interrupt` | `wants: idle` |

Only the blocked statuses carry one. Any other event sends `block=` empty and the
plugin clears the row's reason, so a `plan` label cannot outlive the prompt that
produced it. A heartbeat arriving while the agent is *still* blocked carries no
reason either, and there the plugin keeps the one it already has - the row is
still blocked on the same thing.

An unrecognized value is dropped rather than guessed, so an older installed hook
sending something new degrades to no label instead of a wrong one.

## Background agents from the agent view

Everything above depends on `$ZELLIJ_PANE_ID`. Claude Code's agent view
(`claude agents`, or `claude --bg`) runs sessions under a daemon instead: they
have a pid but no pane, no `ZELLIJ_*` environment, and no hook piping into any
session. That made the agents *most* likely to be blocked on you while you are
elsewhere the ones the panel could not see at all.

They are discovered by two passes with the same asymmetry the spool has, where
one source asserts existence and the other only refines it:

| Pass | Reads | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Job state | `~/.claude*/jobs/<id>/state.json` | Whether a row exists, and everything it renders |
| Live | `claude agents --json` | The live `busy`/`idle` status, nothing else |

The job record carries the agent view's own `detail` line, its `tempo`, the
subagent fan-out and the token count, so a row says what the agent view says.

**The passes are that way round because of a CLI quirk:** `claude agents --json`
ignores `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. It answers for whichever account it resolves by
itself, so running it once per config dir returns *that same account's* agents
every time — the same rows duplicated, not each account's. A fleet routinely
spans accounts, so the job directories are globbed and read directly, and the
live pass runs exactly once. `--json` also lists only *active* sessions, so a
row it omits may simply have finished; completed agents are aged out on their
own timestamp rather than culled for being absent from it.

`age` is computed in the shell and sent as seconds, because the plugin has no
wall clock — the same constraint behind `tool_secs` and the spool's relative
dating.

### One identity for two kinds of agent

Background rows reuse `AgentId` rather than threading a second identity type
through every row, sort and lookup. They take the reserved session key `@bg`,
which no real session can collide with: `sanitize_session` folds every byte
outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, so nothing can sanitize to a key containing `@`. The
eight-hex job id packs into `pane_id` and round-trips exactly through `{:08x}`,
which is how a row rebuilds the id `claude attach` and `claude stop` take
without carrying it separately. On screen the row shows `agents/<account>` and
`id:<job>` rather than a session and a pane number.

Two culling paths have to leave these rows alone, and both would have destroyed
and rebuilt the row on every scan — resetting its elapsed clock and leaving the
panel permanently dirty. `merge_found` must not cull a row the process scan
cannot see, and `apply_liveness` must not read "in no Zellij session" as "dead".

### What the keys do instead

| Key | Pane agent | Background agent |
|---|---|---|
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Focus the pane | Open a pane running `claude attach <id>` |
| <kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>x</kbd> | Interrupt, then close the pane | Arm, then `claude stop <id>` |
| <kbd>y</kbd> / <kbd>m</kbd> / <kbd>f</kbd> | Reply, queue a follow-up | Refused |

Reply and follow-up are refused rather than attempted. Both reach an agent
through a pty or a file keyed by session and pane, and a background agent has
neither — a write would address an unrelated pane, or none, and report success
either way.

A finished background agent stays listed for `JOB_DONE_WINDOW` (six hours), so
the panel shows the working day without filling with last week's runs. Blocked
and working agents are never aged out: how long an agent has been blocked is the
most useful thing the panel can tell you.

Set `ZJ_AGENT_JOBS=0` to switch the whole pass off; the panel falls back to pane
agents alone. It also no-ops silently when `jq` or the `claude` binary is
missing.

## Cross-session status: the spool

The pipe above reaches only the plugin in the agent's *own* session. To give a panel live status
for agents everywhere, the hook also writes one file per agent:

```
$TMPDIR/zj-agent-mob-<uid>/status/<session>.<pane_id>
```

One line, the same `key=value` payload plus a `ts=`. The write is a `printf` to a `.tmp` and a
`mv` into place - no subprocess, nothing to block on, and `rename(2)` is atomic within a
filesystem, so a reader sees the old record or the new one but never a half-written one. That
matters because this runs on the critical path of every tool call.

The panel reads the directory on the same `run_command` that already runs the process scan, so
polling costs one command rather than two.

That scan runs on pane and session events, which is not enough on its own: an agent in another
session can work for ten minutes without opening a pane, and meanwhile the row ages out. So while
any foreign agent is on screen the panel also re-scans every `SPOOL_POLL_INTERVAL` (5s), well
inside the 60s `STALE_AFTER` so a row gets many chances to refresh before it decays. The poll is
gated on a foreign row existing, so a single-session panel never pays for it, and on the session
still being listed, since nothing can refresh a row whose session is gone.

The panel's clock is what paces this, so a foreign row keeps the timer running whatever its status.
An `unknown` row in particular must: it is the row the poll exists to recover, and a panel that
stopped ticking once its rows decayed could never bring them back.

### Urgent transitions skip the poll

A poll cycle is too slow for the states that actually need you, so those are also pushed. Each
open panel touches a beacon file, `panel.<session>`, next to the status records; the hook reads
that directory and, on `waiting` / `failed` / `done` only, additionally runs
`zellij --session <name> pipe` for each panel that is not its own.

The beacon's **filename** is the sanitized session name, which is what compares against the
hook's own `$SESSION`. Its **contents** are the name Zellij actually knows the session by, because
sanitizing is lossy: a session called `my session` is keyed `my_session`, and
`zellij --session my_session` addresses nothing. The same split applies inside the plugin, where
`AgentId.session` is the sanitized key and `real_session()` resolves it back for anything that
takes a `--session` argument.

Because the fold is lossy it can also collide: `my session` and `my_session` are different
sessions that both fold to `my_session`, and one spool file cannot hold two agents - each write
would erase the other's status. So a name the fold **altered** carries a suffix of its own bytes
in hex (`my_session-6d79207365737369`), which the plugin appends the same way. Hex of the raw
bytes rather than a checksum, so neither side has to implement the other's algorithm. Names the
fold leaves unchanged - nearly all of them - keep their plain, readable key.

The restriction to those four statuses is the cost control: tool events fire constantly, and
they must never pay for a subprocess per open panel. Heartbeats take the spool path alone. A
beacon older than five minutes is swept, so a closed panel stops attracting pipes. Set
`ZJ_AGENT_FANOUT=0` to opt out; everything falls back to the poll.

## Notifications

The plugin, not the hook, decides when to notify: it holds every agent's state, so it can
debounce across the fleet where a per-agent hook could not. A transition into a notifying status
is queued rather than sent, and the queue is flushed after a short window, which turns a fan-out
of five blocked agents into one banner instead of five stacked ones.

Three rules keep it from becoming noise: one notification per agent per `notify_cooldown`,
nothing at all while the panel is already on screen, and only the newest state per agent inside a
window. The notifier binary is probed once via `run_command` (`terminal-notifier`, then
`osascript`, then `notify-send`) and cached; finding none disables the feature silently.

Task summaries and tool arguments come from arbitrary repo content, so every one is passed as its
own argv element. `osascript` has no argv form for `display notification`, so the text is bound
through `on run argv` rather than spliced into the script.

### Who owns which row

Three sources can say something about an agent, and they are deliberately not equal:

| Source | Owns | Beats |
|---|---|---|
| Pipe (the agent's own session) | status for home rows | everything, for home rows |
| Spool | status for foreign rows | the scan |
| Process scan | whether a row exists at all | nothing; it asserts existence only |

**The rule that makes this safe: a spool record never creates a row.** Existence comes from the
process scan; the spool only refines a row the scan already justified. So a leftover file cannot
resurrect an agent that exited, and losing the spool degrades to the pre-existing behaviour
(`found` rows) rather than breaking anything.

A home row is skipped by the spool merge entirely: its hook pipes straight into this session, so
the pipe is both fresher and authoritative, and letting a poll overwrite it would flap the row.

Four defences keep a stale record from showing wrong data:

| Defence | Stops |
|---|---|
| No process, no row | A record for an agent that has exited |
| `session_id` must match, unless a newer record disagrees | A recycled pane id inheriting the previous agent's status, while still letting the pane's next agent take the row over |
| `ts` older than `STALE_AFTER` is ignored | A record from a previous boot or a long-idle agent |
| Filename must match the record's own `session`/`pane_id` | A malformed or mislabelled file |

Records are dated relative to the newest one seen rather than against a wall clock: the plugin has
no clock, and this makes a host clock jump unable to pin a row as permanently current. The
reference point is anchored to the panel's tick count, so a record ages as *how far it sat behind
the newest record in its batch, plus how long ago that batch arrived*. Without the second term a
fleet that goes entirely quiet freezes the reference point, and the last record reads as current
forever - which would fight the tick-clock decay and flap the row now that the spool is re-read
every few seconds.

One exception, because the rule above is about records and not about agents: a blocked or idle
agent writes nothing while it sits there, so its record stops advancing and eventually ages out
even though the state is still true. A re-read of an unchanged record therefore re-confirms
`waiting`, `idle-wait`, `idle`, `done` and `failed` - states where silence is exactly what they
predict, and where the process scan still says the agent is alive. It can only ever re-confirm a
status the row already holds, never change one. `working` and `compact` are excluded: they claim
active progress, and silence is evidence against that rather than for it.

`SessionEnd` removes the file. A killed agent fires no `SessionEnd`, so the scan also sweeps
records older than a day - far past `STALE_AFTER`, so they could never render anyway.

The directory is created `0700` and namespaced by uid, because on a shared `/tmp` these records
contain task summaries, which are the user's own prompts. Set `ZJ_AGENT_SPOOL=0` to opt out
entirely; the pipe keeps working for the agent's own session.

## In-flight tool timing

`PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` carry a shared `tool_use_id`. The hook stamps the
start into `inflight.<session>.<pane_id>` next to the spool records and subtracts
at the matching `PostToolUse`, so a call that took a while reports itself:

```
      └ Bash cargo test (94s) · 3 turns · pane:5
```

Only the call that wrote the stamp clears it, matched on `tool_use_id`: tools
nest, and an inner call finishing must not be measured against an outer one's
start. Anything under `ZJ_AGENT_SLOW_TOOL` (10s) is not annotated, so the detail
line stays quiet for the calls that are never the reason you are looking.

The elapsed seconds are computed in the hook rather than sent as an epoch,
because the plugin has no wall clock - the same constraint that makes the spool
date its records relative to each other.

## Answering prompts without being asked

`ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE` is on by default, so a prompt parks in the panel rather than
only in the pane. What makes that bearable at fleet scale is the rules file:

```sh
# ~/.config/zj-agent-mob/approve.rules
allow Read
allow Bash git
```

One `allow <tool> [arg-prefix]` per line. A matching rule answers the prompt
immediately - no pipe, no wait, no interruption - so you are only asked about
something new. <kbd>A</kbd> on a parked prompt approves it *and* appends the
rule, which is how the file gets written in practice.

Allow-only by design. A wrong auto-deny wedges a turn, where a wrong auto-allow
is still bounded by whatever the agent's own sandbox permits, and the rules file
is never rewritten by the panel - only appended to, and only with a line the
user pressed a key for.

## Queueing the next instruction

<kbd>f</kbd> composes a follow-up for the selected agent and drops it in
`followup.<session>.<pane_id>`. The next `Stop` finds it, consumes it, and
returns `{"decision":"block","reason":"<text>"}`, which makes the agent continue
with that text instead of ending its turn. The row reports `working` with
`followup: <text>` rather than the `done` that was about to stop being true.

Unlike a reply, this needs no prompt to be open - a working agent is exactly
what it is for - and it reaches another session, because the transport is a file
rather than a pipe. Nothing queued means `Stop` behaves exactly as it did
before, byte for byte.

## Telling an agent about its neighbours

The panel is the only party that sees the whole fleet, and two agents in one
repository is how a rebase gets stepped on. So on `UserPromptSubmit` the hook
reads its own sibling spool records and, when another *active* agent shares this
`cwd`, injects one note:

```
zj-agent-mob: 1 other agent(s) are working in this same directory right now:
pane 4 (working): refactor the parser
Coordinate before wide-reaching changes (rebases, file moves, dependency bumps).
```

Capped at three peers - a bigger fleet says how many it left out rather than
naming a count it never printed - informational only, and never a veto: `additionalContext`
adds to what the agent knows and cannot block the prompt. It costs the agent
tokens, so `ZJ_AGENT_CONTEXT=0` switches it off. An agent is never told about
itself, and only `working` / `waiting` / `idle-wait` / `compact` records count -
a finished agent is not competition for the working tree.

## Cost per turn

The hook runs on the agent's critical path, so it is worth knowing exactly what
one turn costs before tuning `ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT` and `ZJ_AGENT_FANOUT`.

**Per hook event, always:**

| Cost | When |
|---|---|
| 1 `jq` | Every event. One invocation parses the whole payload into shell variables via `@sh`. |
| 1 `zellij pipe` | Every event that produces a status or a counter delta. |
| 1 file write | Every event, unless `ZJ_AGENT_SPOOL=0`. Done with a shell redirect, not a subprocess. |
| 1 more file write | `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` only, the in-flight stamp. Same redirect-and-rename, no subprocess. Skipped with `ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT=0`. |

**Only on turn-opening boundaries** (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`):

| Cost | Notes |
|---|---|
| 1 `tail -n 300` | Bounded window, so a multi-megabyte transcript is never read whole. |
| 1-2 more `jq` | Claude tries `ai-title` and falls back to `last-prompt`; Codex reads `event_msg` once. |

**Only on turn boundaries and prompts:**

| Cost | Notes |
|---|---|
| 1 spool directory read | `UserPromptSubmit` only, for the fleet note. Skipped with `ZJ_AGENT_CONTEXT=0`. |
| 1 rules file read | `PermissionRequest` only, and only when the file exists. |
| 1 file read | `Stop` only, checking for a queued follow-up. |

**Only on `waiting` / `idlewait` / `failed` / `done`** — the states that actually
need you:

| Cost | Notes |
|---|---|
| 1 extra `zellij pipe` **per open panel elsewhere** | Skipped entirely with `ZJ_AGENT_FANOUT=0`. The beacon files are what it counts, so a machine with one panel pays nothing. |

### What dominates, and what to turn off

`PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` fire **once per tool call**, so in a turn with a
dozen edits they are the whole cost: everything else fires once or twice. That
is why `ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT=0` roughly halves hook volume - it drops both tool
events and the high-frequency counter events (`SubagentStart`, `TaskCreated`)
while leaving turn boundaries, notifications, and permission prompts intact.

The tradeoff is stated in
[troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#waiting-stays-on-screen-after-youve-answered):
with no heartbeat, `waiting` persists until the turn ends, because Claude has no
"permission granted" event and the next tool call is what would have cleared it.

Rough guide:

- **Default (everything on).** Live status, live tool detail, cross-session
  urgency with no poll delay. Right unless you can measure a problem.
- **`ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT=0`.** Halves the volume. Status still moves at turn
  boundaries; mid-turn tool detail and subagent counters stop updating.
- **`ZJ_AGENT_FANOUT=0`.** Only worth it with several panels open at once.
  Foreign rows fall back to the 5-second spool poll, so urgent states arrive
  late rather than not at all.
- **`ZJ_AGENT_SPOOL=0`.** Drops the file write and opts the agent out of
  cross-session visibility entirely. Its own session's panel is unaffected.

The panel's own cost is separate: `discover::scan_script` runs one `ps axeww`
plus a spool read on every `PaneUpdate`, and every 5 seconds
(`SPOOL_POLL_INTERVAL`) while a foreign row is on screen.

## Task summaries

- **Claude Code** transcripts contain an `ai-title` record: Claude's own rolling summary of the session (e.g. "Review Zellij plugin UI rendering documentation"). Falls back to `last-prompt`, then the pane title.
- **Codex** has no equivalent, so the first `event_msg` / `user_message` record from the session rollout is used. Raw `response_item` records are skipped because they're padded with `AGENTS.md` and `<INSTRUCTIONS>` preamble.

Transcripts reach tens of megabytes, so summaries are re-read only on turn-opening boundaries (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`) from a bounded `tail -n 300` window. Tool events send an empty `task=`, and the plugin treats empty as "leave unchanged".

`Stop` needs no transcript read at all: both agents put the turn's closing text in `last_assistant_message`, so a finished row shows what actually happened rather than the summary from before the turn.

## Counter events

`SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` and `TaskCreated` / `TaskCompleted` all fire on the parent's pane, so they cannot carry a status without overwriting the pane's own state. They send an empty `status=` plus a delta (`subagent_delta=1`, `task_done_delta=1`) instead, and the plugin applies it to the existing row. Deltas rather than absolute counts, because the hook is stateless: each event only knows that one more thing started or finished. Counters reset when a new turn begins, and saturate at zero so a stray `Stop` cannot underflow.

These events are high-frequency during a fan-out, so they honour `ZJ_AGENT_HEARTBEAT=0` alongside the tool events.

## Answering permission prompts

On by default (`ZJ_AGENT_APPROVE=0` opts out), and one of the three hooks that deliberately blocks a turn. `PermissionRequest`, `Stop` and `UserPromptSubmit` are registered with `async: false` because an async hook's output cannot influence the turn it belongs to, and each of these three answers, continues, or informs one. Every other hook stays async so it can never stall the agent.

Each of the three also carries a `statusMessage`, so the seconds a synchronous hook spends are attributed on screen instead of looking like a hang.

The plugin cannot write to the stdin of an already-running hook, so the verdict travels through a file:

1. The hook pipes `agent-ask` with a `verdict_file` path and its own timeout, and blocks, polling
   for the file.
2. <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>r</kbd> in the panel writes `allow` or `deny` to that path via `run_command`.
3. The hook reads it and prints `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"decision":{"behavior":"allow"}}}`.

A rule matching the prompt short-circuits all of this before step 1: see [answering prompts without being asked](#answering-prompts-without-being-asked).

The timeout travels with the prompt so the two ends cannot disagree about when it lapsed. Past it
the hook has already fallen through to the agent's own prompt and nothing is reading the file, so
the panel drops the prompt: it stops rendering the box, stops offering the keys, and refuses the
keypress. Otherwise <kbd>a</kbd> would write a verdict into the void and report an approval that
never reached the agent.

Polling rather than a FIFO: opening a FIFO with no reader blocks past any timeout, and Codex parses `async` but does not implement it, so there is nothing to absorb a hang. On timeout the hook prints nothing and exits 0, which falls through to the agent's own prompt - the worst case is the normal interactive experience, never a wedged turn.

The path is passed to `sh -c` as a positional argument rather than interpolated into the command string, so nothing outside the plugin is ever parsed by a shell.

`/goal` sets a session-scoped hook but leaves no on-disk artifact, so goals aren't readable. `ai-title` tracks the real work anyway. For a manual override:

```sh
zellij pipe --name agent-label --args "pane_id=3,label=whatever you want"
```

## The install screen

The plugin runs in WASI with no access to `$HOME`, so it cannot read `settings.json` to see whether hooks are installed. Instead it shells out via Zellij's `run_command` to `~/.config/zj-agent-mob/install.sh status`, which prints one `key=state` line per target:

```text
claude=installed
codex=absent
plugin=installed
hook=installed
```

Results arrive asynchronously as a `RunCommandResult` event, tagged with a context key so install output is never confused with another command's. After any toggle the plugin re-reads state rather than assuming the change landed, because the installer can succeed partially (hooks written, plugin not built).
